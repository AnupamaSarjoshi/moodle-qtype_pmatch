Pattern match question type

This question type was created by Jamie Pratt, working for the Open University
(http://www.open.ac.uk/).

Students can enter a response of up to 20 words, which is then graded by matching
it against vaious model answers that are expressed using a sophisticated patten
matching algorithm. See http://docs.moodle.org/dev/The_OU_PMatch_algorithm

This question type is compatible with Moodle 2.1+.

To install using git, type this command in the root of your Moodle install
    git clone git://github.com/timhunt/moodle-qtype_pmatch.git question/type/pmatch
Then add question/type/pmatch your git ignore.

Alternatively, download the zip from
    https://github.com/timhunt/moodle-qtype_pmatch/zipball/master
unzip it into the question/type folder, and then rename the new folder to
pmatch.
